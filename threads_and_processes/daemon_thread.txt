Garbage collector:
- automatic memory management which runs in the background.
- attempts to reclaim garbage no longer in use by program

Daemon (Background) Thread
- is a thread that will not prevent the process from terminating if it's still running.
- By default threads are created as non-daemon.

When the main thread is finished executing and there are no non-daemon threads left running, the original process can terminate and the daemon thread will terminate with it.
As a result, daemon thread will be abruptly terminated with the process, it didn't have a chance to gracefully shut down.

NOTE: If you detach a thread to make it a background task, make sure it won't have any negative side effects, if it prematurely exits.

- New threads will thread daemon status from their parent.
- Set the daemon property to change status before starting thread.
- Daemon threads do not gracefully exit like normal threads.
