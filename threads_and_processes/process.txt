PROCESS

- includes code, data, and state information
- each instance of a running program
- separate address space and memory


within every process there are one or more smaller sub-elements called threads. they are like tiny processes.

THREAD

- independent path of execution
- only exist as a part of a process (subset of a process)
- threads are the most basic units that operating system manages and it allocates time on the processor to actually execute them (operating system schedules threads for execution)


Threads that belong to the same process share the same address space which gives them access to the same resources and memory including the program's executable code and data.

Sharing resources between separate processes is not as easy as sharing between threads in the same process. Because every process exists in its own address space.

There are ways to communicate and share data between processes, but it requires a bit more work than communicating between threads.
You have to use system provided Inter-Process Communication mechanisms(IPC):
- like Sockets and Pipes.
- Allocating special inter-process shared memory space
- or using remote procedure calls



THREADS VS. PROCESS
- Threads are lightweight - require less overhead to create and terminate.
- OS can switch between threads faster than processes.
