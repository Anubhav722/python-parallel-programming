When multiple threads each have multiple tasks to perform, making those threads block and wait, every time they try to acquire a lock that's already taken may not be neccessary or efficient.

TRY LOCK:
- Non blocking lock/acquire method for mutex. It returns immediately and one of two things will happen.
- If the mutex we are trying to lock is available, lock it and return true.
- If the mutex is already possessed by another thread, the try lock method will immediately return false.
